## 🔄 How It Works

### Workflow Overview

SecureFlow operates through a streamlined workflow that ensures security and fairness at every step:

```
1. Job Creation → 2. Application/Selection → 3. Work Start → 4. Milestone Submission → 5. Approval/Dispute → 6. Payment Release
```

### Detailed Flow

#### 1. **Job Creation** 🎯

Clients can create jobs in two ways:

- **Open Job Marketplace**: Create a job without specifying a freelancer. Anyone can apply.
- **Direct Contract**: Create a job directly with a known freelancer address.

**What happens:**

- Client deposits funds (XLM or whitelisted token) into the escrow contract
- Sets up milestones with amounts and descriptions
- Defines project details (title, description, deadline)
- Optionally sets up arbiters for dispute resolution
- Funds are locked in the smart contract

#### 2. **Application & Selection** 📝

For open jobs:

- **Freelancers Browse**: View all available open jobs in the marketplace
- **Apply to Jobs**: Freelancers submit applications with:
  - Cover letter explaining their approach
  - Proposed timeline for completion
  - Their Stellar address
- **Client Reviews**: Client can see all applications for their job
- **Selection**: Client chooses a freelancer from the applicants
- **Contract Activation**: Once selected, the contract is ready to begin

For direct contracts:

- Job is created with a specific freelancer address
- No application process needed
- Contract is immediately ready to start

#### 3. **Work Start** 🚀

- **Freelancer Initiates**: The chosen freelancer calls `start_work()` to activate the contract
- **Status Change**: Escrow status changes from `Pending` to `InProgress`
- **Work Begins**: Freelancer can now start working on milestones

#### 4. **Milestone Submission** 📦

- **Freelancer Completes Work**: After completing a milestone, freelancer submits it
- **Submission Details**: Includes milestone index and updated description
- **Status Update**: Milestone status changes to `Submitted`
- **Awaiting Approval**: Client is notified and can review the work

#### 5. **Milestone Review** ✅❌⚖️

Client has three options for each milestone:

- **✅ Approve**:
  - Client approves the milestone
  - Payment is automatically released to the freelancer
  - Milestone status changes to `Approved`
  - Freelancer's reputation increases

- **❌ Reject**:
  - Client rejects the milestone with feedback
  - Milestone status changes to `Rejected`
  - Freelancer can resubmit the milestone with improvements
  - Rejection reason is stored and displayed to the freelancer

- **⚖️ Dispute**:
  - Either party (client or freelancer) can dispute a milestone
  - Client raises a dispute with a reason
  - Milestone status changes to `Disputed`
  - Admin and arbiters are notified
  - Dispute resolution process begins

#### 6. **Dispute Resolution** ⚖️

When a dispute is raised:

- **Admin Review**: Platform admin reviews the dispute
- **Arbiter Assignment**: Admin can authorize additional arbiters if needed
- **Resolution Process**: Admin resolves the dispute by determining payment split
  - Sets amount to be paid to freelancer (0 = full refund to client, >0 = partial/full payment to freelancer)
- **Resolution Display**:
  - Both client and freelancer see the resolution outcome on their job cards
  - Clear indication of who won: "Freelancer won" with amount or "Client won - Full refund issued"
  - Transparent display of resolution results for accountability

#### 7. **Payment & Completion** 💰⭐

- **Automatic Release**: Approved milestones trigger automatic payments
- **Partial Payments**: Each milestone is paid individually
- **Platform Fees**: Fees are automatically deducted and sent to fee collector
- **Completion**: When all milestones are approved, the contract is marked as `Completed`
- **Reputation Update**: Both parties' reputation scores are updated
- **Client Rating**:
  - After project completion, clients can rate freelancers (1-5 stars)
  - Written reviews are stored on-chain
  - Ratings affect freelancer's average rating and badge tier
  - Rating data is displayed on freelancer profiles and job applications

#### 8. **Refunds** 💸

Refunds can occur in several scenarios:

- **Before Work Starts**: Client can refund if no work has started
- **After Deadline**: Emergency refund after deadline expiration
- **Dispute Resolution**: Refunds can be issued as part of dispute resolution
- **Automatic**: Automatic refunds after deadline if work isn't completed

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contract Architecture

The SecureFlow smart contract is modular and consists of several key components:

```
SecureFlow Contract
├── Admin Module          # Platform administration and controls
├── Escrow Core          # Core escrow data management

├── Work Lifecycle       # Milestone tracking and work flow
├── Refund System        # Refund mechanisms and emergency refunds
└── Storage Types        # Data structures and types
```

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with modern web technologies:

- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript

## 🔧 Smart Contract Details

### Key Functions

#### Job Creation

```rust
pub fn create_escrow(
    depositor: Address,
    beneficiary: Option<Address>,  // None for open jobs
    arbiters: Vec<Address>,
    required_confirmations: u32,
    milestones: Vec<(i128, String)>,
    token: Option<Address>,  // None for native XLM
    total_amount: i128,
    duration: u32,
    project_title: String,
    project_description: String,
) -> Result<u32, Error>
```

#### Marketplace

```rust
pub fn apply_to_job(
    escrow_id: u32,
    cover_letter: String,
    proposed_timeline: u32,
    freelancer: Address,
) -> Result<(), Error>

pub fn accept_freelancer(
    escrow_id: u32,
    freelancer: Address,
    depositor: Address,
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

#### Work Lifecycle

```rust
pub fn start_work(
    escrow_id: u32,
    beneficiary: Address,
) -> Result<(), Error>

pub fn submit_milestone(
    escrow_id: u32,
    milestone_index: u32,
    description: String,
    beneficiary: Address,
) -> Result<(), Error>

pub fn approve_milestone(
    escrow_id: u32,
    milestone_index: u32,
    depositor: Address,
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

#### Dispute Resolution

Disputes are handled through the milestone approval process. When a client disputes a milestone, arbiters can vote on the resolution.

#### Refunds

```rust
pub fn refund_escrow(
    escrow_id: u32,
    depositor: Address,
) -> Result<(), Error>

pub fn emergency_refund_after_deadline(
    escrow_id: u32,
    depositor: Address,
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

### Escrow States

- **Pending**: Job created, waiting for work to start
- **InProgress**: Work has started, milestones being completed
- **Released**: All milestones approved, contract completed
- **Refunded**: Funds refunded to client
- **Disputed**: Dispute raised, awaiting resolution
- **Expired**: Deadline passed

### Milestone States

- **NotStarted**: Milestone not yet started
- **Submitted**: Work submitted, awaiting approval
- **Approved**: Approved by client, payment released
- **Disputed**: Dispute raised
- **Resolved**: Dispute resolved
- **Rejected**: Rejected by client

### Security Considerations

- All write operations require authentication
- Only contract owner can perform admin functions
- Token whitelisting prevents unauthorized tokens
- Arbiter authorization ensures trusted dispute resolution
- Platform fees are configurable and transparent
